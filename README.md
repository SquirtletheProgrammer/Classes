This folder contains code for all of the classes I've taken thus far. Feel free to snoop around and see what piques your interest! Or don't. It's a free country.  
If you are a student taking one of the classes, please have integrity and respect the honor code.  
If you want to disregard the honor code, do so at your own risk.
